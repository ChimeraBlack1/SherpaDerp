# SherpaDerp
All-in-one software for DDL.

SherpaDerp is software that unites administrative processes for the Sales People, Administrators, Accounting, Service Dispatch, and Executives in one. 
The need for this software arose from the usage of multiple software packages that had a hard time communicating with one another.  We have one for accounting that doesn't include all the features we would like to have.
An advantage of paying no licensing fees and having the software built in house to meet the exact needs of DDL was another driving factor. Because the software is specific to one company, it can be very lightweight and features can be added on the fly without paying inflated development costs to a third party.  The software can also be scaled to include more members of any part of the company without additional cost.  
Now instead of having to decide who 'really' needs a license and who doesn't, everyone has access.  When new employees join the company we don't have to commission new licenses, and if the company contracts, we aren't committed to too many licenses.
